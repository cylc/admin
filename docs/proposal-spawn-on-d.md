## Introduction

Implementation PR [cylc-flow#3515](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3515).

See below for [terminology](#terminology).

### Background

We first considered replacing task-cycle-based
[Spawn-On-Submit](spawn-on-submit-history) (SoS)
with graph-based Spawn-On-Demand (SoD) in
[cylc/cylc-flow#993](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/993).
The ultimate solution might be
[cylc/cylc-flow#3304](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3304)
but that requires major Cylc 9 refactoring. It turns out we can implement SoD
by itself within the current system just by getting task defs (during
graph parsing) to record who depends on each output, so that task proxies can
spawn downstream children as outputs are completed - still a self-evolving pool
of task proxies with no graph computation at run time.

### Advantages

- A dramatically smaller task pool; size independent of spread over cycle points
- real task pool size limiting without risk of stall: the SoD task pool only
  contains active tasks, so the global queue limits task pool size 
- No dynamic dependency matching (parents updates child prerequisites directly)
- No (or much less, at least) iteration over the task pool
- An easily-understood graph-based "window on the workflow"
- Users should not have to know about the "task pool" and the concepts of task
  "insert" and "remove" anymore.
- Task instances can run out of cycle point order
   - no stalling due to unspawned tasks downstream of a failure
- No need for suicide triggers in alternate path branching
- No need to manually insert the first instance of a newly-defined task (unless
  perhaps it has no parents)
- Achieve ongoing "reflow" by simply re-triggering a task

## Implementation summary

At start-up:
- auto-spawn first instances of parentless tasks (i.e. with no prerequisites)

Then, as outputs get completed:
- spawn downstream tasks on demand if not already spawned,
  and update their prerequisites directly
- as parentless tasks are released from the runahead pool, auto-spawn their
  next instances
- remove finished tasks (succeeded, handled-failed, expired); leave
  unhandled failed tasks in the pool as unfinished
- shut down if stalled with no unfinished tasks present

## Implementation details

### Spawn-on-outputs or spawn-when-ready?

If a task depends on the outputs of multiple parents (AND trigger) there will
be a period when it has partially satisfied prerequisites, because
the outputs will not all be completed at the same time (in fact the parents
might not even pass through the task pool at the same time). That being the
case, when exactly does SoD "demand" that we spawn the task? The options are:
- spawn the task as *waiting* when the first upstream output is completed, and
  then have it track its own prerequisites until ready (**spawn on outputs**), or
- start tracking the task's prerequisites internally when the first upstream
  output is completed, and spawn it as ready only when the prererequisites are
  satisfied (**spawn when ready**)

Spawn-on-outputs was easiest to implement first because it leverages our task
proxies' existing ability to manage their own prerequisites. This generates
some waiting tasks that might seem to create other problems, but a bit of
thought shows *there is actually no fundamental difference between
spawn-on-outputs and spawn-when-ready*. They are just slightly different ways
of doing exactly the same thing, which is to manage partially satisfied
prerequisites. To see this, note that we could effectively implement
spawn-when-ready by spawning waiting task proxies on outputs but keeping them
in a hidden pool until satisfied. Even in the main pool they don't have to
affect the workflow any differently than separately-managed prerequisites (e.g.
if ignored during runahead computation they won't stall the workflow). It
should not make any difference to users either, whether or not a yet-to-run
task is backed by a waiting task proxy or is just an abstract task with real
prerequisite data attached to it. Housekeeping is the same too: we either
remove satisfied prerequisites to avoid a memory leak, or remove spent task
proxies that contain the same satisfied prerequisites.

However, we should change later to spawn-when-ready with separate management of
prerequisites, just because it's cleaner and slightly more efficient (no excess
task proxy baggage, just the prerequisites) and doesn't invite confusion about
the implications of waiting task proxies. The scheduler could (e.g.) maintain a
dict of `(task-id, [prerequisites])`: create a new entry when the first parent
output of `task-id` is completed, update it with subsequent outputs, and delete
it when the prerequisites are satisfied and the task can run. The dict would
also have to be stored in the DB for restarts.

For completeness, see also [can we use the database or datastore to satisfy
prerequisites?](#can-we-use-the-database-or-datastore-to-satisfy-prerequisites)

**UPDATE: DONE** [cylc/cylc-flow#3823](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3823)
(Current implementation just keeps partially satisfied task proxies in the
runahead pool until satisfied).


### Preventing conditional reflow

If a task depends conditionally on the outputs of multiple parents (OR
trigger), we need to stop the task being spawned separately by each parent
ouput (because the outputs will not all be completed at the same time, and in
fact the parents may not even pass through the pool at the same time). 
```
A | B => C
```
Here, if `C` triggers off of `A` first, we need to stop it spawning again when
`B` completes later on. We can't rely on the existence of `C` in the task pool
to stop this because `C` could be finished and gone before `B` completes.

We can prevent this "conditional reflow" very simply, by spawning only if the
database says the task was not previously spawned in this flow. This requires
an extra DB query for every late output in a conditional trigger (where late
means the downstream task has finished and gone before the next parent output
is generated). It has no impact on AND triggers where the task will
remain in the pool until it runs, and a spawn-time DB query is needed to get
[submit number](#submit-number) anyway.  

It seems unlikely this extra DB access will be a problem, but see [possible
in-memory prevention of conditional
reflow](#possible-in-memory-conditional-reflow-prevention).

### Prerequisite housekeeping?

The minimum housekeeping requirement is to delete partially satisified
prerequisites once satisfied (or for spawn-on-outputs, reset the waiting
tasks that contain those prerequisites, to ready) then remove task proxies once
finished.

The more interesting question is: can prerequisites get stuck forever as
partially satisfied (or stuck waiting tasks for spawn-on-outputs), and if so
what should we do about that?

*Note this is not a SoD-specific problem. It is even worse in SoS where have to
worry about tasks gettings stuck wholly unsatisfied as well. There we force
users to clean them all up with suicide triggers, or else let them stall the
workflow.*

We have provisionally decided not to attempt automatic removal of stuck
prerequisites on grounds that *partial completion of the requirements for a
task to run* probably means something is wrong that the user needs to know
about. It can only happen if some of the associated outputs were generated
while others were not. That could mean:
- a parent did not show up
  - (workflow not stalled) maybe we just haven't waited long enough yet
  - (workflow stalled) just a secondary symptom of an upstream problem
- a parent succeeded without generating an expected output
  - an error that needs attention
- a parent failed unhandled
  - we consider the parent unfinished and leave it for the user to
    fix-and-retrigger, which would also allow the child to run
- a parent failed handled and was removed as finished
  - bad failure handling that did not fix the workflow or clean up?

If any of the above do prove problematic we could leave this as a remaining
niche case for suicide triggers, or consider [possible stuck-prerequisite
housekeeping](#possible-stuck-prerequisite-housekeeping).

Note that [reflow](#reflow) can also generate tasks that are stuck waiting on
off-flow outputs, but these should not be removed.

### Spawning parentless tasks

Tasks with no prerequisites (or which only depend on clock or external
triggers) need to be auto-spawned, because they have no parents to "demand"
them. At start-up we auto-spawn the first instances of these tasks, then
whenever one is released from the runahead pool, spawn its next instance.

(In future, we may want to spawn tasks "on demand" in response to external
trigger events too, but for now a waiting task with an xtrigger is fine).

### Absolute dependence

At first glance this is not a great fit for the spawn-on-demand model: 
```
...
      R1/2 = "start"
      P1 = "start[2] => bar"
```
Above, with no final cycle point a single event (`start.2 succeeded`) should
spawn an infinite number of children (`bar.1,2,3,...`), which obviously is not
feasible.

(Note without the first line above `start` is not defined on any sequence, so
with SoS the scheduler will stall with `bar` unsatisfied, but with SoD it will
shut down immediately with nothing to do because `bar` never gets spawned.)

Worse, `bar` could also have other non-absolute triggers, and it could be
those that spawn initial instances of `bar` before `start` is finished:
```
...
      R1/2 = "start"
      P1 = "start[2] & foo => bar"
```
Above, if `foo` runs 3x (say) faster than `start` then roughly speaking the
first three instances of `foo` will spawn the first three instances of `bar`
before `start.2` is done. This suggests we might need to do repeated checking
of unsatisfied absolute triggers until they become satisfied. However, it turns
out that's not necessary...

#### Absolute trigger implementation:

1. Whenever an absolute output (e.g. `start.2:succeed` above) is completed the
scheduler should:
   - Remember it forever, via a list held by the task pool module and an
    associated DB table (to load the data again on restart).
   - Spawn (if not already spawned) the first downstream child (`bar.1` above)
    **and** update the prerequisites of potentially multiple subsequent
    children already in the pool due to spawning by others (e.g. `foo` above).
2. Whenever a task with an absolute trigger (`bar` above) is spawned, check to
see if the trigger is already satisfied. If it is, satisfy it. If it isn't then
it will be satisfied later when the absolute parent finishes and updates all
child instances present in the pool as described just above. 
3. Whenever a task with an absolute trigger is released from the runahead
pool spawn its next instance (strictly speaking this is only necessary for
tasks with no non-absolute triggers to spawn them on demand).

#### Retriggering

Retriggering a finished absolute parent (with `--reflow`) causes it to spawn
its first child, and subsequent instances of the parent will also continue to
be spawned as they drop out of the runahead pool as described above.

- [TODO](#todo) should we always auto-spawn these tasks in a reflow?
- [TODO](#todo) specify a new first child on retriggering an absolute parent?

### Failed task handling

We have provisionally decided to remove failed tasks immediately as finished if
handled by a `:fail` trigger, but otherwise leave them in the pool as
unfinished, in anticipation of user intervention.

However we may want to reconsider this later; see [better failed task
handling?](#better-failed-task-handling)

### Workflow stop

If the workflow stalls, that means there is nothing else to do (given the
graph and what transpired at run time)
- if there are failed or waiting tasks in the pool, log this as a stall and
  stay up
- otherwise shut down as completed

This works fine but I think we could do better - see [better workflow
completion handling.](#better-workflow-completion-handling)

**UPDATE: DONE** [cylc/cylc-flow#3823](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3823)


#### Task pool content at shutdown

With a stop point prior to the final cycle point (stop now etc.) the scheduler
will stop with waiting tasks in the runahead pool beyond the stop point. This
allows a restart to carry on as normal, beyond the stop point.

The task pool will be empty on stopping at the final cycle point because
that represents the end of the graph where all recurrence expressions end.
It is not possible to restart from here. To go beyond the final cycle point
you need to change the final cycle point in the workflow definition and 
restart from an earlier checkpoint, or warm start prior to the new final point.

### Suicide triggers

Suicide triggers are no longer needed for workflow branching because waiting
tasks do not get spawned on the "other" branch. Below, if A succeeds only C
gets spawned, and if A fails only B gets spawned:
```
A:fail => B
A => C
```

Tim W's case: `B` triggers and determines that `xtrigger1` can never be
satisfied, so we need to remove the waiting `A` (the two xtriggers are watching
two mutually exclusive data directories for a new file):
```
@xtrigger1 => A
@xtrigger2 => B
```
As described this remains a case for suicide triggers (although they won't be
needed here either if we can spawn xtriggered-tasks "on demand" too, in response
to xtrigger outputs).

We will keep suicide triggers for backward compatibility, and in case they are
still useful for rare edge cases like this.

#### Suicide trigger implementation

Suicide triggers are just like normal triggers except for what happens once
they are satisfied (i.e. the task gets removed instead of submitting). In
particular, the suicide-triggered task has to keep track of its own
prerequisites so it knows when it can be removed.

```
foo & bar => baz 
```
Above, if `foo` (say) succeeds before `bar`, then `baz` will be
spawned (if not already spawned elsewhere) by `foo:succeed` and its
prerequisites updated, before later being updated again by `bar:succeed`, and
then it can **run**.

Simliarly for suicide triggers:
```
foo & bar => !baz 
```
Here, if `foo` (say) succeeds before `bar`, then `baz` will be spawned (if not
already spawned elsewhere) by `foo:succeed` and its prerequisites updated,
before later being updated again by `bar:succeed`, and then it can be
**removed**.

Normally in the case of suicide triggers `baz` will already have been spawned
earlier, so both `foo` and `bar` will just update its prerequisites and log
a message about not spawning it again in this flow, and it will be removed once
both are done. If it was spawned earlier but removed as finished, then only the
messages will be logged (in this case `baz` doesn't need to track its own
prerequisites and remove itself once they are satisfied, because it has already
been removed).

### Submit number

Submit number should increment linearly with any re-submission, automatic retry
or forced retriggering.

In SoS retriggering a finished task that is still in the pool just increments
the in-memory submit number. Otherwise submit number gets looked up in the DB,
**but this is broken:** re-inserted tasks get the right submit number from the
DB, but their spawned next-cycle successors start at submit number 1 again.

In SoD we have the additional complications that finished tasks don't stay in
the pool, and reflows can be triggered over the top of an earlier flow.
We can't assume that submit number always starts at 1 in the original flow
because it is possible to trigger a "reflow" out the front of the main flow.
The only foolproof method to always get the right submit number (and thus never
clobber older job logs) is to look it up in the DB whenever a new task is
spawned. As it turns out the same DB query can also determine associated flow
labels (next).

## Reflow

Reflow means having the workflow continue to "flow on" according to the graph
from a manually re-triggered task.

### Reflow in SoS

A restricted form of reflow occurs automatically in SoS if you (re-)insert
and trigger a task with only previous-instance dependence (`foo[-P1] => foo`). 

Otherwise it requires laborious manual insertion of downstream task proxies
and/or state reset of existing ones to set up the reflow.

### Reflow in SoD

Reflow naturally happens in SoD. Consider the cycling workflow graph:

![reflow-example](img/sod.png)

*Retriggering a finite sub-graph from a bottleneck task* is straightforward and
safe:
- Trigger `woo.2`, then `bar.2`, `baz.2`, and `qux.2` will follow, and the
  reflow will stop.

*Retriggering an ongoing cycling workflow from a bottleneck task* is equally
straightforward:
- Trigger `foo.2`, then the workflow will carry on from that point just like
  the original flow

*Retrigging a non-bottleneck task will cause a stalled reflow* without manual
intervention, because previous-flow outputs are not automatically available
- Triggering `baz.2` will result in an waiting `qux.2` with an
  unsatisfied dependence on `bar.2`
- But the intervention to deal with this is straightforward and consistent:
  - Tell Cylc to spawn the child of `bar.2:succeeded` (before triggering
    `baz.2` to set up an automatic reflow, or after to unstall it)
  - OR trigger `qux.2` after `baz.2` finishes, to make it run despite
    its unsatisfied prerequisite

*Conditional reflow prevention* must be flow-specific. In `A | B => C` if `C`
spawns off of `A` in flow-1, we should not spawn another `C` off of `B` in
flow-1, but we should spawn another `C` if flow-2 hits the trigger later on.

### Flow labels and merging

To distinguish different flows, tasks associated with the same flow have a
common *flow label* that is transmitted downstream to spawned children.

Users should probably be advised to avoid running multiple flows in the same
part of the graph at the same time, unless they know what they're doing,
because that would likely involve multiple sets of identical or near-identical
jobs running at nearly the same time, which would likely be pointless. However,
the system should ensure that nothing pathological happens if one flow does run
into another.

We could make flows independent (able to pass through each other unimpeded) but
that just seems like a perverse way of running multiple instances of the same
workflow at once.

Instead, if one flow catches up to another, they should merge together. The
only way to achieve this, realistically, is to merge flow labels wherever a
task from one flow encounters the same task from another flow already present
in the task pool. So flows merge gradually, not all at once. When this happens
the task will take forward a new merged flow label that can act as either of
the original flows downstream.

Flow labels are currently implemented as a random character chosen from the set
`[a-zA-Z]`, with merged labels represented by joining the upstream labels. So
if flow "a" catches up with flow "U", the merged flow will be labelled "aU" and
will act as if it belongs to "a", "U", or "aU". This allows for 52 concurrent
flows, which should be plenty, but is super easy to read and type (c.f.
verbose UUIDs merging to a list of UUIDs).

There's no need to keep track of which is the original flow, it doesn't matter.

We should periodically and infrequently (main loop plugin) remove flow labels
that are common to the entire task pool. If flows 'a' and 'U' merge, eventually
all labels will contain 'aU' (and some may carry additional labels as well from
more recent triggering). At that point we might as well replace 'aU' with a
single character label.

### Reflow restrictions

- Don't reflow by default, just trigger (require `cylc trigger --reflow`)
- Stop a labeled flow: stops tasks with a sole label match from spawning,
  and removes the label from tasks with multiple (merged) labels

## CLI implications

- `cylc insert` not needed. In SoD just trigger a task - auto insertion is
  needed because there aren't any waiting or finished tasks hanging around to
  be triggered.

- `cylc spawn` is repurposed to spawn downstream on specified outputs.
   - *now renamed to `cylc set-outputs`*

- `cylc remove` not needed?  In SoS removing a task instance from the pool
  removes the abstract task entirely from the workflow, if the next instance
  isn't spawned first. In SoD removing active tasks doesn't make sense (the job
  is already active) and will not stop future instances being spawned on
  demand. We can keep the it temporarily for removal of stuck waiting 
  tasks, until we go to spawn-when-ready.

- `cylc reset` not needed. In SoS this forces the state of task instances in
  the pool to change, to change the result of subsequent dependency negotiation
  (to get a task to run) e.g. to lie that a failed task succeeded. SoD does not
  have non-active tasks or dependency negotiation. Abstract tasks out front are
  already "waiting" and don't need to be in the task pool. Finished tasks are
  removed immediately. Failed tasks are just historical information and
  pretending they succeeded is unnecessary - better force downstream tasks to
  carry on despite the upstream failure (with `cylc spawn`, above).

- `cylc reflow` - tentative new command for managing reflows, so far just
  supports canceling a reflow.

### CLI task globbing:

In SoS we glob on:
- name and cycle point to match instances in the task pool:
   - `spawn`, `poll`, `kill`, `remove`, `reset`, `trigger`
- name only, for a given cycle point, to match abstract tasks:
   - `insert` 

In SoD we need to glob on:
- name and cycle point to match active tasks in the task pool:
  - `poll`, `kill`
- name only, for a given cycle point, to match abstract tasks:
  - `spawn`, `trigger`
- actually trigger needs both kinds of globbing: we might still want to
  re-trigger multiple unhandled failed tasks at once (i.e. match in the task
  pool) for instance.

## Web UI implications

Primarily:
- n>0 windowing:
  - UIS needs to populate n>0 abstract tasks with historical data
  - Probably only allow n=1 (next task) in the future direction

Approaching a stop point:
- If the workflow is told to shut down before the final cycle point (i.e.
  before the end of the graph) there may be some waiting tasks held back in the
  runahead pool because they are beyond the stop point even though they have all
  prerequisites satisfied.  TODO: do we need the UI to make this clear?
  Probably not (other than making the approaching scheduler stop point clear) -
  it isn't really any different from waiting satisfied tasks held back because
  they are beyond the runahead limit. 

Graph isolates: expanding the n-distance window will not reveal tasks that are
not connected (via the graph) to n=0 tasks (nasty example: cycling workflows
with no inter-cycle dependencies).How should the UI make these easily discoverable?
- Provide and "n-max" window that includes whole cycle points?
- Or is searching or filtering by name sufficient?

Reflow:
- Need to distinguish between reflow and main-flow in the UI so that it is
  clear to users why a task with off-reflow dependence is stuck waiting
  (off-reflow parents will appear as finished if the window is expanded).
  Simply distinguishing reflow from main flow should be sufficient because it
  will be relatively easy to explain the problem to users (compared to SoS)
- Allow selecting part of the graph, or particular tasks, to define the
  bounds of a reflow?

Task Outputs:
- The SoD analogue of "task state reset" in SoS, is to tell a task to spawn
  graph-children of particular outputs. E.g. If a task failed but we want to
  the workflow to carry on as if it succeeded, in SoS we would reset the failed
  to succeeded and dependency matching would result in triggering of downstream
  tasks that depend on its success.  Changing a failed task to succeeded isn't
  ideal because it hides the fact that it actually succeeded, but at least the
  change to succeeded is obvious to users. For SoD we would leave the task as
  failed (changing its state to succeeded wouldn't have any effect) but tell it
  to spawn based on the `:succeeded` output even though it failed. This is more
  elegant, but we need to make what happened obvious to users by getting the UI
  to display the state of individual outputs (in the workshop we considered UI
  design for custom outputs - can use the same for standard outputs?)

## Appendices

### Possible in-memory conditional reflow prevention

(For comparision with DB-based conditional reflow prevention
[above](#preventing-conditional-reflow).

This would involve remembering that a task was previously spawned until all of
its parents are finished - at which there are no parents left to cause the
problem.

My initial implementation involved keeping finished task proxies in the pool
until their parents were finished, but that required spawning on completion as
well as on outputs, and task proxies can only hold the finished status of all
their parents if spawned on completion as well as on outputs (e.g. to catch
parents that finished by failure instead of success). This was a departure from
the SoD concept, and it created extra (non on-demand) waiting tasks that also
required parents-finished housekeeping. Too complicated.

A simpler in-memory solution is feasible though: maintain (e.g.) a dict of
`(spawned-task-id, [list of unfinished parents])`. Create a new entry when the
first parent finishes, and update it on subsequent parent completions. Remove
the entry once the list of unfinished parents is empty. This dict would also
have to be stored in the DB for restarts. Some tricky housekeeping might be
needed though: what to do with dict entries that get "stuck" because one or
more parents never run at all. That could happen after upstream failures, in
which case fixing the failure might fix the problem, but it could also happen
when the parent tasks are on different alternate paths.
  
**Can we use the datastore instead of the DB?:** parents are one edge from
children, so if we keep n=1 tasks in the scheduler datastore, can we use that
to see if the child was spawned already? Kind of: the child can drop out of n=1
if there is a gap between parents running, in which case it has to be loaded
into n=1 again from the DB when the next parent shows up. So this avoids the
in-memory housekeeping problem but only by secretly using the DB as long term
memory. Plus, *we want to keep only n=0 in the scheduler datastore if
possible.*

### Can we use the database or datastore to satisfy prerequisites?

We've chosen in-memory management of partially satisfied
prerequisites [above](#spawn-on-outputs-or-spawn-when-ready), but for
completeness here are two other possible solutions.

**Pure DB:** when an output is completed we could try to satisfy the
prerequisites of the downstream task using the DB. This would involve looking
up all of the other contributing parent outputs each time. If the prerequisites
are completely satisfied, spawn the task, otherwise don't. This would avoid any
need for prerequisite housekeeping, but at the cost of a lot more DB access for
tasks with many parents. 

**Can we use the datastore to satisfy prerequisites?** Prerequisites are n=1
edges, so could we keep n=1 in the scheduler datastore and use that to check
prerequisites before spawning? The answer is no because the as-yet-unspawned
child task is n=1 from the parent that just generated the output, but all the
other parents have to be checked as well to resolve its prerequisites, and they
are n=2 from the original parent. So what about keeping n=2 in the datastore?
Kind of: we can check all parents at n=2 whenever an output is generated, but
parents don't have to run concurrently so they can drop out of n=2 between
one parent running and the next, in which case they would have to be loaded 
into n=2 from the DB again when the next parent shows up. So this would work,
but with back-door use of the DB as long term memory. Plus *we want to keep
only n=0 in the scheduler datastore if possible*.

### Possible stuck-prerequisite housekeeping

We have provisionally decided not do to automatic housekeeping of stuck
prerequisites - see [above](#prerequisite-housekeeping).

If we change our minds about this, we could potentially remove partially
satisfied prerequisites (spawn-on-ready) or waiting tasks (spawn-on-outputs)
if their parent tasks are all finished, and perhaps also if the rest of the
workflow has moved on beyond them, because at that point nothing could satisfy
them automatically.

Stuck prerequisites are not an immediate problem, it only matters if they 
accumulate over time. We don't have to let them stall the workflow either
(although they are often the result of a failure that causes it to stall). So
housekeeping could be done by checking the status of the relevant parent tasks
via the DB at stall time, or perhaps by infrequent periodic main loop plugin.

### Better failed task handling?

We currently remove failed tasks as finished if handled by a `:fail` trigger,
but otherwise leave them in the pool as unfinished, in anticipation of user
intervention.

However it would be simpler just to remove all failed tasks, and that would
be fine because:
- the scheduler does not need failed tasks in the pool to do its job
- ability to retrigger does not depend on continued presence in the pool 
  (it needn't affect reflow/no-reflow triggering either)
- it doesn't have to impact how failed tasks are presented in the UI either
- it's not necessarily true that failed tasks are finished if `:fail` is
  handled and not finished if not. Correct failure handling could be done by
  an event-handler; and we may still want to retrigger a handled failed task if
  the `:fail`-handler did not do the right thing

Handling all failed tasks equally would also make for simpler and more
consistent workflow completion handling (below).

### Better workflow completion handling?

**UPDATE: DONE** [cylc/cylc-flow#3823](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3823)

Completion and shutdown handling as described ([above](#workflow-stop))
leaves a bit to be desired.

In SoD the following workflow will complete and shut down after running only
`a`, i.e. it won't be identified as a stall (it would in SoS):
```
graph = "a:out1 => bar"
[runtime]
   [[a]]
       script = true
```
That's the correct thing to do according to the graph. If `a` does not generate
the `out1` output, there is no path to `bar`, and the workflow is complete. 

This on the other hand:
```
graph = """a & b => bar
          # and optionally:
        b:fail => whatever"""
[runtime]
   [[a]]
       script = true
   [[b]]
       script = false
```
... will be identified as a stall, even though there is no path to `bar` here
either. There will be a partially satisfied (waiting) `bar`, and (depending
on how we handle failed tasks) a failed `b` in the pool.

That seems inconsistent. In fact there's really no need to make
potentially-incorrect value judgements about the meaning of partially satisfied
prerequisites, handled or unhandled failed tasks, or stall vs completion.
An unexpected failure might cause the worklfow to stall by taking a side path,
but it is impossible for us to know what the "intended" path is (who are we to
say that the supposed side path was not actually the intended path?)

Instead (simple!):
- If the workflow stalls for any reason, there is by definition nothing else to
  do, so just say that and shut down (possibly after a timeout to allow quick
  intervention).
  - If there are partially satisfied prerequisites present, by all means log
  them, but that does not necessarily imply a premature stall (see example
  above)
- The user can then look at what led to the stall, if necessary intervene to
  make the workflow continue on again, on a different path

Aside on current flawed SoS completion logic: tasks are spawned ahead as
waiting regardless of what is "demanded" by the graph at run time, but the
workflow still proceeds "on demand". If the scheduler stalls with waiting tasks
present we infer a premature stall, but that might not be a valid conclusion.
The scheduler got to this point by doing exactly what the graph said to do
under the circumstances that transpired, and who are we to say that the user
did not intend that? But unfortunately in SoS we may end up with a bunch of
off-piste waiting tasks to deal with, and we use those to infer an intention to
follow a different path.

### Automatic use of off-flow outputs?

This is possible in principle but we have decided against it as difficult and
dangerous. Also, it is really not necessary. SoD reflow is a big improvement
even without this (less intervention, straightfoward and consistent).

(Note we actually have a similar-but-worse problem in SoS: previous-flow task
outputs will not be used automatically unless those tasks happen to still be
present in the task pool - and users do not generally understand what
determines whether or not those tasks will still be present).

(For the record, in case we ever reconsider automatic use of off-reflow
outputs, graph traversal would be required to determine whether or not an
unsatisfied prerequisite can be satisfied later within the reflow or not, and
if not, to go the database. As Oliver noted: this could probably be worked
out once at the start of the reflow; it could also help us show users
graphically the consequences of their intended reflow).

### TODO

The following have been transferred to [sod-follow-up Issues in
cylc-flow](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/labels/sod-follow-up)

- (DM) Do we need to support reflow without continued spawning of parentless or
  absolute-parented tasks?  Example:
  ```
  R1 = start
  P1 = start[^] => foo => bar & baz => qux
  ```
  If I retrigger `foo.6` with `--reflow` it should cause `bar.6` and `baz.6`
  then `qux.6` to run, but it will also result in `foo.7` being spawned and so
  on - is that to be expected or not? (Note we an already get restricted
  child-only reflow by triggering `foo.6` without reflow, and then `cylc spawn
  foo.6` [now `cylc set-outputs`] to spawn the children of `foo.6`).

- Consider allowing users to specify the first child to be spawned by a
  retriggered absolute parent rather than going back to the first cycle (use
  case: retrigger a start-up task that rebuilds a model but does not re-run all
  the old cycles that depend on the model build, just new ones; alternatively,
  just retrigger the absolute parent without reflow, then retrigger (with
  reflow) the first child that you want the children to continue from).
 
- Consider the clarity and usefulness of all SoD log messages. Messages about
  [not spawning suicide-triggered tasks](#suicide-trigger-implementation) have
  been noted as confusing. Move most to DEBUG level?

- Don't auto-spawn all tasks with an absolute trigger, just those that *only*
  have absolute triggers (auto-spawning them all isn't really a problem, but it
  is less "on demand" than it could be).

- Event-driven triggering: easy (see TODO at the end of
  `task_pool:spawn_on_ouput`) but need to consider the effect on batched job
  submission.
  - **UPDATE: DONE** [cylc/cylc-flow#3898](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3938)

- Consider re-instating (most of?) the pre-SoD `cylc insert` functional tests
  as `cylc trigger` tests.

- "Hold" currently means to hold back *waiting task proxies*. In SoD we can
  still hold a suite, but holding individual tasks is impossible except for
  partially satisfied waiting tasks.
  - Do we really need the concept of individual task hold?
  If we do, options include:
  - (maybe) holding an active task causes its spawned children to be held?
  - (probably) allow users to target any task, which will require the scheduler 
    to check a list of tasks-to-hold at spawn time

- Consider if current flow label management is sufficient, and allow users to
  associate metadata with flow labels so they can keep track more easily.
 
- Flow stop is currently implemented as `cylc stop --flow=LABEL`. Consider
  better integrating this other stop functionality; and also hold etc. From Oliver:
  > Consider a way to pull flow name into the generic identification system in
  > the guise of:
  >
  > ```
   $ cylc hold <workflow> <cylc>
   $ cylc hold <workflow> <task>.<cycle>
   $ cylc hold <workflow> <task>.<cycle>^<flow>
   $ cylc hold <workflow> ^<flow>
```

- Event-driven removal of finished tasks is not compatible with the way the
  datastore is updated by iterating the task pool once per main loop (so we
  miss final status changes).

- Generally ensure that users do not need to understand the "task pool"
  anymore, beyond the distinction between active and not-active tasks.
  - e.g. no more glob-matching of the task pool on task state (`cylc trigger`
    already converted over to targetting any task)
  - the result of retriggering should be the same regardless of whether or not
    the target task is already in the pool. This could matter for handled (not
    in pool) vs unhandled failed (in pool) tasks - which I'm suggesting we
    treat equally and remove them all; and partially-satisfied (in pool) vs
    wholly unsatisfied (not) waiting tasks - but note the former should really
    only be treated as embodied prerequisites - see [spawn-on-outputs or
    spawn-when-ready?](#spawn-on-outputs-or-spawn-when-ready).

- The retrigger vs reflow distinction is clear when the target task is well in
  front of or behind the original flow, but what about retriggering a failed
  task? Presumably that should result in the original flow continuing (if the
  retriggered task succeeds and satisfies downstream prerequisites) even if the
  user did not use `cylc trigger --reflow`?

- Other ways of stopping a reflow? (at a cycle point, or at a list of task
  IDs?)

- (Edit-run has been removed, but that needs to be re-implemented via UI + UIS)

- In storing satisfied prerequisite status in the DB task pool table, OS is not
  happy that "the keys to a JSON dictionary are themselves JSON" and suggests
  "This should be converted into its own DB table pre-8.0.0." - search for
  "satisfied" in `cylc/flow/suite_db_mgr.py` and `cylc/flow/task_pool.py`. 
  - **UPDATE: DONE**  
  [cylc/cylc-flow#3863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3863)

- Rethink runahead limiting. A global queue with cycle-point priority release
  would be better because it limits activity within a cycle point as well as
  across cycle points
  [cylc/cylc-flow#3874](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3874)
  Note also the global queue provides real task pool size limiting without risk
  of stall, not just active task limiting, because the task pool only contains
  active tasks.

- Go to spawn-when-ready instead of spawn-on-outputs, as discussed above
  - **UPDATE: DONE** [cylc/cylc-flow#3823](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3823)

- Try to avoid all remaining iteration over task proxies

- Can we make prerequisite updates more efficient (it uses the old dependencies
  matching methods)

- Extend SoD to clock- and external-triggers: tasks could be spawned in
  response to trigger events (depends on xtriggers as main-loop coroutines)
- (Consider all "possible" Appendix items above)

### Terminology

- **parent** and **child** tasks: upstream and downstream graph relationships.
  (Not runtime inheritance!)
- **task**: an abstract node in the workflow graph (task name at a particular cycle point)
- **task proxy**: an object in the scheduler program representing a particular
  task that the scheduler is currently aware of
- **task pool**: pool of current "active" task proxies
- **runahead pool**: task proxies that have been spawned (created) already but
  are beyond the current runahead limit, or beyond the (non-final) stop point.
  All tasks are initially spawned into the runahead pool then released to the
  main pool as the workflow (and the runahead limit) moves forward.
- **n=0 window**: tasks that anchor the current view (by default, the content of
  the active task pool)
- **n=M window**: tasks within M graph edges of the those in the n=0 window
- **finished**: means *succeeded*, OR *failed* with the *:fail* trigger
  handled. An unhandled failed task is retained in the task pool as "not
  finished"
- **reflow**: when the workflow flows on according to the graph, from a
  manually triggered task
